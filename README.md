hackhers 2023 submission

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the current state of our climate. We wanted to figure out ways to reduce our water footprint as college students. 

## What it does
We created a mockup of an application that tracks and logs personal water usage.
 
## How we built it
We used the application Figma to design the user interface of our application. 

## Challenges we ran into
We struggled with the UX research portion of the project. We were trying to figure out realistic ways the app could help someone reduce their water usage. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We wanted the UI accessible for everyone, and we accomplished this by making it easy to navigate. 

## What we learned
Through this application, we learned about the nuances of Figma. 

## What's next for WateRU Using?
We hope to one day implement this design into a full-stack mobile application.
